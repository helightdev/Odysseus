Odysseus is an easy-to-use framework for creating Minecraft Mini-Games or Adventure Games,
based on the paper-spigot api. Our goal is to create a feature packed framework which can 
be used by experienced developers as well as beginners without a development background. 
The design is strongly inspired by Unity.
